# Kanban-Only End-to-End Validation Runbook

This runbook validates the Hermes Runtime workflow without patching Hermes core.

The initial runtime topology is Kanban-only:

- The user gives a natural-language request.
- The Commander profile plans the work.
- Advisor Gate audits the plan and assignment.
- Commander records Advisor results on Kanban.
- Commander creates Kanban tasks for Worker profiles.
- Workers read tasks with `kanban_show` and finish with `kanban_complete` or
  `kanban_block`.
- Commander integrates Kanban evidence and runs final Advisor checks.

`delegate_task` is not part of this initial smoke.

## Roles

| Role | Runtime evidence | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| User | Natural-language prompt | State the desired outcome |
| Commander | `commander` profile, session id, Kanban comments | Plan, audit calls, Kanban task creation, integration |
| Worker | Kanban task assignee profile and task run | Execute assigned task only |
| Advisor | `advisor_audit` and `advisor_resolution_gate` receipts | Review-only audit |
| Kanban | Task body, comments, events, runs, completion metadata | Durable source of truth |

## Deterministic Plugin Checks

Run this in the repository checkout:

```bash
mise run check
```

For the focused end-to-end plugin scenario:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py
```

Expected result:

```text
tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py .  [100%]
```

The focused test proves this sequence:

1. A mutating action is blocked before `A1_PLAN`.
2. `A1_PLAN` passes with user request, Commander interpretation, plan,
   coverage table, risk level, constraints, and evidence.
3. The mutating action is allowed after same-turn `A1_PLAN`.
4. `kanban_create` is blocked before `A2_DELEGATION`.
5. `A2_DELEGATION` passes with Commander plan, Kanban Worker assignment,
   assignee, scope, expected evidence, empty-result policy, and risk level.
6. `kanban_create` is allowed after same-turn `A2_DELEGATION`.
7. Kanban tool evidence is recorded for task creation, task read, and task
   completion.
8. A planned tool failure is recorded.
9. Final delivery requests `A3_EXCEPTION`.
10. `A3_EXCEPTION` passes.
11. Final delivery requests `A3_FINAL`.
12. `A3_FINAL` receives Kanban Worker evidence in the final packet.
13. Final delivery requests `advisor_resolution_gate`.
14. `advisor_resolution_gate` records Commander continuation.
15. Final delivery is allowed.

## Pi Validation

On the Pi host, update the repository checkout:

```bash
cd /home/pi/hermes-runtime
git pull --ff-only
mise run check
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py
```

Refresh the installed plugin through the official Hermes installer:

```bash
hermes plugins install poruru210/hermes-runtime/plugin/advisor-gate --force --enable
sudo systemctl restart hermes-serve.service
hermes config check
hermes doctor
hermes plugins list --plain --no-bundled
hermes tools list
```

Verify the Commander profile:

```bash
hermes profile list
hermes -p commander profile show commander
```

Expected signs:

```text
advisor-gate: enabled
Tool Availability: advisor_gate
Profile: commander
```

Do not commit live receipt files, Hermes logs, tokens, `.env`, auth files, or
terminal captures that contain secrets.

## Minimal Kanban Tool Precheck

This verifies that the Commander profile can create a Kanban task and that a
Worker can read and complete a Kanban task.

Create a blocked, create-only verification task from Commander:

```bash
hermes -p commander chat -Q --max-turns 4 -t kanban -q \
  'Call kanban_create exactly once with title "advisor precheck: commander can create kanban task", assignee "default", tenant "advisor-precheck", body "Verification card created by Commander chat to confirm kanban_create availability. Do not execute this card.", idempotency_key "advisor-precheck-commander-create-20260706", and initial_status "blocked".'
```

Expected:

- A task id is returned.
- `hermes kanban show <task-id> --json` shows the task.
- The task is `blocked` or is manually blocked immediately after verification.

Create a Worker verification task:

```bash
hermes kanban create 'advisor precheck: worker can read and complete kanban task' \
  --body 'Minimal Worker precheck. On dispatch, read this card via kanban_show, do not modify files, then call kanban_complete with a short summary saying the task was read and completed with no file changes.' \
  --assignee default \
  --tenant advisor-precheck \
  --idempotency-key advisor-precheck-worker-complete-20260706 \
  --initial-status running \
  --json
```

Before dispatch, confirm there are no unrelated ready tasks:

```bash
hermes kanban list --status ready --json
```

Dispatch one task:

```bash
hermes kanban dispatch --max 1 --json
```

Poll until the task is `done` or `blocked`:

```bash
hermes kanban show <task-id> --json
hermes kanban log <task-id>
```

Pass when:

- The task reaches `done`.
- The events include `claimed`, `spawned`, heartbeat events, and `completed`.
- The run includes a completion summary and metadata.
- The Worker process exits after completion.

## Natural-Language Commander Smoke

Use a new Commander conversation. The prompt should not ask the user to act as
the orchestrator or name internal phases.

User-facing prompt:

```text
Please verify that this repository's Advisor Gate Kanban workflow is wired
correctly. Use Kanban as the durable task board, create only the minimum Worker
task needed for evidence, keep the Worker scope read-only, record Advisor
results on the Kanban task, and report the final result with task ids and
unresolved items.
```

Expected Commander behavior:

- Interpret the user request.
- Run `advisor_audit` for `A1_PLAN` before mutating or assigning work.
- Create or identify a parent Kanban task for the smoke.
- Comment the A1 result on the parent task.
- Prepare one or more narrow Worker assignments.
- Run `advisor_audit` for `A2_DELEGATION` before `kanban_create` or
  `kanban_link`.
- Create Worker task(s) with concrete scope and expected evidence.
- Dispatch Worker task(s).
- Wait for `done` or `blocked`.
- If Advisor returns `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, comment the finding and create or
  reopen Kanban work before retrying.
- If Advisor returns `BLOCK`, block the relevant task and stop final delivery.
- Include Kanban task ids, completion summaries, metadata, and unresolved items
  in `A3_FINAL`.
- Run `advisor_resolution_gate` before final delivery.

Expected evidence:

- One Commander session id.
- One parent Kanban task id.
- `A1_PLAN`, `A2_DELEGATION`, `A3_FINAL`, and `RESOLUTION_GATE` receipts.
- A Kanban comment recording each Advisor result.
- One or more Worker Kanban task ids.
- Each Worker task has `kanban_show` and `kanban_complete` or `kanban_block`
  evidence.
- Final answer does not hide unresolved Advisor findings.

## Pass / Fail Criteria

Pass only when all of these are true:

- No Hermes core files are changed.
- Plugin checks pass locally and on Pi.
- The focused end-to-end test passes on Pi.
- Hermes reports `advisor-gate` enabled and `advisor_gate` available.
- The `commander` profile exists and has the Kanban toolset.
- Receipts show the A1/A2/A3/ResolutionGate sequence.
- Kanban `show` can reconstruct the plan, Advisor results, Worker assignment,
  Worker completion, and unresolved items.
- Final delivery is blocked until current `A3_FINAL` and resolution gate exist.

Fail or unresolved when any of these are true:

- `kanban_create` can run before A2 when A2 gating is enabled.
- A Worker exits without `kanban_complete` or `kanban_block`.
- Advisor findings are not written back to Kanban comments or completion
  metadata.
- A final draft can pass without current `A3_FINAL`.
- A passed `A3_FINAL` can finish without `advisor_resolution_gate` when
  resolution gate is required.
- Verification depends on local logs or secrets that cannot be shared.
