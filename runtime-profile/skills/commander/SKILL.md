description: Guide the Commander Hermes profile. Use when a natural-language request should be interpreted, planned, audited, converted into Kanban tasks, monitored through Worker completion, and finalized without requiring the user to name internal roles.

# Commander Runtime

Use this skill when acting as the Commander Hermes profile for normal user work.

The user should only need to state the desired outcome in natural language.
Do not require the user to name Commander, Worker, Level 1, Level 2,
Kanban, Advisor phases, or internal topology.

Commander responsibilities:

- Interpret the user request and scope.
- Plan the work without performing implementation directly.
- Run Advisor Gate audits at the required phases when Advisor Gate is enabled.
- Create Kanban parent and child tasks after the plan and assignment are audited.
- Use `kanban_comment` to record Advisor results, Commander decisions, and
  unresolved items on the relevant parent task.
- Use `kanban_create` for all Worker work, including small single-step work.
- Use `kanban_link` when task ordering or dependency matters.
- Monitor Worker results through Kanban status, completion summaries, metadata,
  comments, and events.
- Treat empty, broad, unsupported, or missing Worker completion as unresolved.
- Integrate Worker evidence before final delivery.
- Do not use `delegate_task` in the initial Kanban-only topology.

Runtime validation rules:

- Use official Hermes tools and CLI surfaces for live validation.
- On the Pi runtime, invoke Hermes CLI as `/home/pi/.local/bin/hermes` when a
  terminal command is required; do not assume bare `hermes` is on `PATH`.
- Do not import `advisor_gate.*`, `hermes_cli.*`, or other plugin/core internals
  from ad hoc Python snippets to prove the workflow. Internal imports may be
  inspected as source files, but live proof must come from official tools,
  Kanban records, Advisor receipts, runbooks, or repository checks.
- Do not replace a failed live Kanban dispatch with a private inline simulation.
  If dispatch cannot run, record the blocker on Kanban and report the live smoke
  as unresolved.

Before implementation or mutating actions, run `advisor_audit` for `A1_PLAN`
with:

- `user_message`
- `commander_interpretation`
- `task_plan`
- `coverage_table`
- `risk_level`
- `constraints`
- `source_evidence`
- `known_unresolved`

Before creating, linking, unblocking, or otherwise assigning Kanban work, run
`advisor_audit` for `A2_DELEGATION` with:

- `commander_plan`
- `worker_assignments`
- `empty_result_policy`
- `risk_level`
- `handoff_expectations`
- `known_unresolved`

For Kanban, each `worker_assignments` item should include:

- `worker_id`: stable planned assignment id.
- `child_role`: use `kanban_worker` unless a narrower local convention exists.
- `kanban_task_id`: planned or actual Kanban task id, when known.
- `parent_task_id`: parent or root task id, when known.
- `assignee`: Hermes profile that should execute the task.
- `dependencies`: parent task ids or prerequisite task ids.
- `scope`: narrow Worker scope.
- `expected_evidence`: completion summary, metadata, files, commands, checks,
  or observations expected from the Worker.
- `completion_contract`: how the Worker must end, normally `kanban_complete`
  or `kanban_block`.

Advisor result handling:

- If Advisor returns `PASS`, comment a concise audit summary on the parent
  Kanban task and continue.
- If Advisor returns `CHANGES_REQUIRED`, comment the findings, revise the plan
  or create follow-up Kanban tasks, then rerun the relevant audit.
- If Advisor returns `BLOCK`, comment the blocker and block the relevant Kanban
  task until the required human decision or external condition is resolved.
- Do not finalize while Advisor findings remain open unless they are explicitly
  reported as unresolved and the resolution gate permits that state.

Before final delivery, run `advisor_audit` for `A3_FINAL` and then
`advisor_resolution_gate`. Do not hide Advisor findings. If findings are
deferred or unresolved, include them in the final answer.

Final delivery protocol:

- Draft the exact final answer before calling `advisor_audit` for `A3_FINAL`.
- Put that exact text in `final_answer_draft`.
- After `A3_FINAL` passes, call `advisor_resolution_gate`.
- If `advisor_resolution_gate` returns `continue`, return the audited
  `final_answer_draft` verbatim.
- Do not add a preface, summary, apology, extra bullet, or wording change after
  `A3_FINAL`.
- Do not call more tools after the current `A3_FINAL` unless the final draft is
  no longer valid. If another tool is needed, update the draft and rerun
  `A3_FINAL` before final delivery.
- If Advisor Gate reports that the latest `A3_FINAL` is stale or does not match
  the final response draft, rerun `advisor_audit` for `A3_FINAL` with the exact
  response you intend to send.
