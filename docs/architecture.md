# Architecture

This repository is a personal Hermes runtime monorepo.

It is organized around four top-level areas:

```text
plugin/
  advisor-gate/

runtime-profile/
  config/
  skills/
  runbooks/
  locks/

docs/
  image-spec-compliance.md
  architecture.md
  operations.md

tests/
```

## Responsibilities

| Area | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `plugin/advisor-gate/` | Advisor Gate plugin implementation: tools, hooks, schemas, policy, receipt store |
| `runtime-profile/config/` | Sanitized Hermes runtime configuration examples |
| `runtime-profile/skills/commander/` | Commander behavior guidance for the Kanban orchestrator profile |
| `runtime-profile/skills/worker/` | Worker behavior guidance for Kanban-dispatched task sessions |
| `runtime-profile/skills/advisor-flow/` | Advisor audit workflow guidance |
| `runtime-profile/runbooks/` | Pi install, live smoke, and rollback operations |
| `runtime-profile/locks/` | Non-secret runtime and plugin version locks |
| `docs/` | Architecture, operations, image-spec compliance, and historical design records |
| `tests/` | Plugin and runtime-flow verification |

## Role Model

Hermes core is not forked or patched.

Commander and Worker are runtime roles expressed through existing Hermes
behavior:

- Commander: dedicated Hermes profile that interprets the user request, plans,
  runs Advisor audits, creates Kanban task graphs, records Advisor results on
  Kanban, and resolves Advisor findings.
- Worker: Hermes profile spawned from a Kanban task. It reads its assigned task
  with `kanban_show` and finishes with `kanban_complete` or `kanban_block`.
- Advisor: review-only plugin tools and hooks implemented by
  `plugin/advisor-gate`.

Advisor does not choose decomposition, worker count, Kanban tasks, or Worker
assignments. It audits the Commander-selected plan, assignment, evidence,
exception handling, and final answer.

The initial runtime topology is Kanban-only. `delegate_task` remains a Hermes
feature and a compatibility gate target, but it is not part of the baseline
workflow.

## Source Of Truth

Use this order:

1. Current Hermes Agent official docs.
2. Current Hermes Agent source code.
3. This repository's docs and runtime profile.
4. Task prompt.

If docs and source disagree, source wins. If behavior cannot be verified from
docs or source, record it as unresolved.

## No-Core-Patch Policy

This runtime profile must stay inside official Hermes configuration, plugin,
hook, and skill surfaces unless a future ADR explicitly approves a minimal core
patch.

Historical design notes remain under `docs/` for traceability.
