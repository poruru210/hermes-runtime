# End-to-End Validation Runbook

This runbook validates the Advisor overlay without patching Hermes core.

The validation defines roles at the scenario level:

| Scenario role | Hermes-backed evidence | Advisor responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| User | The validation request in the A1 packet | Source request to compare against the plan |
| Commander | Parent `session_id` and the caller of Advisor tools | Plan, delegation, exception handling, final decision |
| Worker | Child `session_id` plus `child_role` from Hermes subagent hooks | Narrow execution result and evidence |
| Advisor | `advisor_audit` and `advisor_resolution_gate` | Review-only audit, findings, verdicts, receipts |
| Receipt | Advisor JSONL records | Evidence that the flow ran in order |

## Scope

This validates the plugin and skill design through official Hermes plugin
surfaces:

- `advisor_audit`
- `advisor_resolution_gate`
- `pre_tool_call`
- `post_tool_call`
- `subagent_start`
- `subagent_stop`
- `pre_verify` / final delivery gate behavior

It does not validate Hermes standard session-history integration. That remains
outside the plugin-only scope.

## Deterministic Plugin Flow

Run this in the repository checkout:

```bash
mise run check
```

For the focused end-to-end scenario:

```bash
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py
```

Expected result:

```text
tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py .  [100%]
```

The focused test proves this sequence:

1. A mutating action is blocked before `A1_PLAN`.
2. `A1_PLAN` passes with user request, Commander interpretation, plan,
   coverage table, risk level, constraints, and evidence.
3. The mutating action is allowed after same-turn `A1_PLAN`.
4. Delegation is blocked before `A2_DELEGATION`.
5. `A2_DELEGATION` passes with Commander plan, Worker assignment,
   `child_role`, Worker scope, expected evidence, empty-result policy, and risk
   level.
6. Delegation is allowed after same-turn `A2_DELEGATION`.
7. A Worker child session start is recorded.
8. Final delivery is deferred while the Worker is active.
9. A Worker child session stop is recorded.
10. A planned tool failure is recorded.
11. Final delivery requests `A3_EXCEPTION`.
12. `A3_EXCEPTION` passes.
13. Final delivery requests `A3_FINAL`.
14. `A3_FINAL` receives observed Worker role evidence from receipts.
15. Final delivery requests `advisor_resolution_gate`.
16. `advisor_resolution_gate` records Commander continuation.
17. Final delivery is allowed.

## Pi Validation

On the Pi host, update the repository checkout:

```bash
cd /home/pi/hermes-advisor-gate
git pull --ff-only
mise run check
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_end_to_end_flow.py
```

Refresh the installed plugin through the official Hermes installer:

```bash
hermes plugins install poruru210/hermes-advisor-gate/plugin/advisor-gate --force --enable
hermes gateway restart
hermes config check
hermes doctor
hermes plugins list --plain --no-bundled
hermes tools list
```

Expected signs:

```text
advisor-gate: enabled
Tool Availability: advisor_gate
```

Do not commit live receipt files, Hermes logs, tokens, or local terminal logs.
Record only sanitized command outcomes in documentation or final reports.

## Live Commander / Worker Smoke

Use a new Hermes conversation after the plugin is installed and enabled.

User-facing prompt:

```text
Please check whether this repository's Advisor Gate is wired correctly for
planning, delegation, worker evidence, exception handling, final audit, and
resolution recording. Use read-only inspection where possible, split the work
only if it is useful, and include concrete evidence before finalizing.
```

The user prompt intentionally does not assign Commander, Worker, Level 1, or
Level 2 roles. Those are implementation roles inferred from Hermes' parent
session, child session, and `child_role` evidence.

Expected Commander behavior:

- Run `advisor_audit` for `A1_PLAN` before implementation or mutating actions.
- Decide whether delegation is useful.
- If delegating, run `advisor_audit` for `A2_DELEGATION` before delegation.
- Keep Worker scope narrow and evidence-focused.
- Include Worker evidence and observed receipts in `A3_FINAL`.
- Record `advisor_resolution_gate` before final delivery.
- If any Advisor result is `CHANGES_REQUIRED` or `BLOCK`, resolve or report it
  instead of finalizing.

Expected evidence:

- One parent Commander session id.
- `A1_PLAN`, `A3_FINAL`, and `RESOLUTION_GATE` receipts.
- If delegation is used, one or more Worker child session ids.
- If delegation is used, `child_role` recorded for each Worker.
- If delegation is used, an `A2_DELEGATION` receipt before delegation.
- If any tool failure occurs, an `A3_EXCEPTION` receipt after that failure.
- Final answer does not include hidden unresolved Advisor findings.

## Pass / Fail Criteria

Pass only when all of these are true:

- No Hermes core files are changed.
- Plugin checks pass locally and on Pi.
- The focused end-to-end test passes on Pi.
- Hermes reports `advisor-gate` enabled and `advisor_gate` available.
- Receipts show the Commander/Worker/Advisor sequence in order.
- Final delivery is blocked until current `A3_FINAL` and resolution gate exist.

Fail or unresolved when any of these are true:

- `child_role` is missing from Worker evidence.
- A final draft can pass without current `A3_FINAL`.
- A passed `A3_FINAL` can finish without `advisor_resolution_gate` when
  resolution gate is required.
- A tool failure after the latest exception audit can finish without a later
  `A3_EXCEPTION`.
- Verification depends on local logs or secrets that cannot be shared.
